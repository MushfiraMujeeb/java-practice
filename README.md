# Movie Ticket Booking System (Java)

Developed a console-based Movie Ticket Booking System using Java as part of an assignment/project. The system allows users to browse available movies, select showtimes, book tickets, and view booking details. This project helped me practice core Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation, as well as user input handling and basic data validation.
